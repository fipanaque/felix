    "text": "B.Sc. Industrial and Systems Engineer with a strong focus on process optimization, MBA and, Neuroscience Ph.D. candidate at the Univeristy of Tsukuba in Japan. Previously, tech entrepreneur.I currently live in Tsukuba, Japan’s renowned science city, where I am actively working on my next business venture.\nI am working on a project aimed at advancing the collection of emotional brain wave data during sleep, with the goal of improving our understanding of how emotions influence behavior. This work could lead to the development of brain-computer interfaces that enhance our ability to diagnose and treat brain disorders, such as depression and anxiety. This would be possible by enabling more precise monitoring and intervention based on emotional brain activity.\nPreviously, I founded PickApp (now Scharff Express), which later became a leading provider of software solutions for the transportation industry. PickApp was acquired by Scharff Inc. (FedEx Representative - Peru) in December 2017, hitting a milestone within the startup ecosystem in Peru. You can see the news here..This project was part of the 2nd generation of StartUp Peru and Ynnovadores.\nThroughout my career, I have developed deep understanding of the entire value chain from concept to launch, business development, strategic innovation and key partnerships.\nI have managed and executed over 100 improvement projects across Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and Spain, many of which continue to deliver value today. I am passionate about helping businesses and entrepreneurs develop and implement digital strategies, leveraging design thinking and lean startup methodologies."

Before entering academia, I co-founded and scaled a tech startup in the ecommerce space—an experience that refined my skills in product development, strategic innovation, and market alignment.\nDriven by a strong interest in human behavior and the mind, I moved into research and am now pursuing a Ph.D. at the University of Tsukuba. My current research focuses on how the brain processes emotions during dreams, with the long-term goal of creating science-based tools to improve sleep and mental performance.\nI’m using my research to build my next startup, combining brain-computer interface (BCI) technology and behavioral science to create new solutions for sleep and emotional health.\nI work with Dr. Takashi Abe at the International Institute for Integrative Sleep Medicine (IIIS) in Japan, where we apply the latest neuroscience techniques to real-world problems.\n  My CV is available here"
