    "text": "Technological innovation fuels my passion. I am an Industrial & Systems engineer from Universidad de Piura in Peru, I hold a MBA from Universidad Los Andes in Colombia , Neuroscience PhD candidate at the Univeristy of Tsukuba in Japan, and tech entrepreneur. I am currently living in Tsukuba, Japan’s renowned science city, where I am actively developing my next business idea.\nI envision a future where we share dream emotions just as easily as we share pictures and videos. This idea laid the groundwork for my Ph.D. Employing a neuroscience approach I link the brain activity of emotional experiences during wakefulness and dreaming states upon awakenings. Since dreams have a long history of being linked to emotional processing, they hold the potential to shape and influence human behavior, such as, adopt new habits, make better decisions or improve attention.\nIn 2014, I founded PickApp (now Scharff Express), a groundbreaking collaborative platform that used a social credit system to increase delivery guys’ digital reputation and make last-mile delivery more efficient for the logistics industry. In December 2017, PickApp was acquired by Scharff Inc. (FedEx Representative - Peru), hitting a milestone within the startup ecosystem in Peru. You can see the news here.\nAs an engineer, I have rolled out operational and manufacturing improvements across Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and Spain. I enjoy assisting businesses and entrepreneurs to get their projects off the ground using a lean startup mindset."
