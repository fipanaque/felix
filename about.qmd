Technological innovation fuels my passion. I earned my bachelor in Industrial & Systems engineer at [Universidad de Piura](https://www.udep.edu.pe/) in Peru, I hold a MBA from [Universidad Los Andes](https://uniandes.edu.co/en) in Colombia. I am a Neuroscience PhD candidate at the [Univeristy of Tsukuba](https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/) in Japan. Previously, [tech entrepreneur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_PyRRqietw). I am currently living in Tsukuba, Japan's renowned science city, where I am actively developing my next business idea. 

I envision a future where we share dream emotions just as easily as we share pictures and videos. This idea laid the groundwork for my Ph.D. Employing a neuroscience approach I link the brain activity of emotional experiences during wakefulness and dreaming states upon awakenings. Since dreams have a long history of being linked to emotional processing, they hold the potential to shape and influence human behavior, such as, adopt new habits, make better decisions or improve attention.

In 2014, I founded PickApp [(now Scharff Express)](https://www.holascharff.com/en/solutions/people-and-entrepreneurs/){target="_blank"}, a groundbreaking collaborative platform that used a social credit system to increase delivery guys' digital reputation and make last-mile delivery more efficient for the logistics industry. In December 2017, [PickApp was acquired by Scharff Inc.](https://www.facebook.com/felixipanaquear/photos/a.314611525680937/335734870235269/){target="_blank"} (FedEx Representative - Peru), hitting a milestone within the startup ecosystem in Peru.

As an engineer, I have rolled out operational and manufacturing improvements across Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and Spain. I enjoy assisting businesses and entrepreneurs to get their projects off the ground using a lean startup mindset.
