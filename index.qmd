<br> <br> Welcome, and thank you for your interest.

My name is Felix, and I bring a unique background that bridges entrepreneurship and neuroscience. Before entering academia, I co-founded, scaled and exited tech startup in the ecommerce space—an intense hands-on journey that sharpened my skills in product development, lean innovation, and finding real product-market fit.

Driven by a strong interest in human behavior and the mind, I moved into research and am now pursuing a Ph.D. at the University of Tsukuba in Japan. My current research focuses on how the brain processes emotions during dreams, with the long-term goal of creating science-based tools to improve sleep and mental performance.

I’m using my research to build my next startup, combining brain-computer interface (BCI) technology and behavioral science to create new solutions for sleep and emotional health.

I work with Dr. Takashi Abe at the International Institute for Integrative Sleep Medicine [(IIIS)](https://wpi-iiis.tsukuba.ac.jp/), where we apply the latest neuroscience techniques to real-world problems.
