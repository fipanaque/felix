<br> <br> Welcome! My name is Felix. I am a Ph.D. student with a research focus on understanding the neural mechanisms underlying emotions in dreams. 

Through my research, I aspire to develop insights and interventions that can help individuals enhance the quality of their sleep and unlock the full potential of their cognitive abilities.

As a former tech entrepreneur who transitioned into a scientist to gain new ideas and knowledge, I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and human behavior. 

Currently, I am using behavioral, computational, and neuroimaging methods to help people improve the their sleep quality.

I collaborate with Dr. Abe Takashi in the [Human Sleep Lab](https://www.u.tsukuba.ac.jp/~abe.takashi.gp/) at the International Institute for Integrative Sleep Medicine [(IIIS)](https://wpi-iiis.tsukuba.ac.jp/), University of Tsukuba in Ibaraki, Japan.


<br> <br> My CV is available [here](files/CV_Felix_2024_v1.pdf).
