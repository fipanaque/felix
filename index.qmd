<br> <br> I am an entrepreneur who transitioned into a scientist to gain new ideas for my next startup. 

Currently, I am pursuing my PhD in Neuroscience with a research focus on understanding the neural mechanisms underlying emotions in dreams. 

I am using behavioral, computational, and neuroimaging methods to help people improve the quality of their sleep.

I collaborate with Dr. Abe Takashi in the Human Sleep Lab at the International Institute for Integrative Sleep Medicine [(IIIS)](https://wpi-iiis.tsukuba.ac.jp/), University of Tsukuba in Ibaraki, Japan.

<br> <br> My CV is available [here](files/Felix Ipanaque_CV.pdf).
