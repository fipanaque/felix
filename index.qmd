<br> <br> Welcome, and thank you for your interest.

My name is Felix, and I bring a unique background that bridges entrepreneurship and neuroscience. Before entering academia, I co-founded and scaled a tech startup in the ecommerce space—an experience that refined my skills in product development, strategic innovation, and market alignment.

Driven by a strong interest in human behavior and the mind, I moved into research and am now pursuing a Ph.D. at the University of Tsukuba. My current research focuses on how the brain processes emotions during dreams, with the long-term goal of creating science-based tools to improve sleep and mental performance.

I’m using my research to build my next startup, combining brain-computer interface (BCI) technology and behavioral science to create new solutions for sleep and emotional health.

I work with Dr. Takashi Abe at the International Institute for Integrative Sleep Medicine [(IIIS)](https://wpi-iiis.tsukuba.ac.jp/) in Japan, where we apply the latest neuroscience techniques to real-world problems.
